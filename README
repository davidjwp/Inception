use this to do a clean slate on docker deleting everything

sudo -s
systemctl stop docker
rm -rf /var/lib/docker
systemctl start docker
sudo docker network rm $(sudo docker network ls)
exit

to delete all users from wp database

sudo docker exec -it wordpress << EOF
cd /var/www/wordpress
wp user delete --allow-root --network $(wp user list --allow-root)

install classic editor 16.3 plugin if blank new-post page


to show data in the database

mysql -u root -p"{$DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}"

SHOW DATABASES;

USE db-name;

SHOW TABLES;

SELECT * FROM $any_table LIMIT 10

for corrections you will need to use the VM (obviously) so you need to share files between host and the vm.

shut down the VM 

settings->Shared folders

add a folder anywhere on host it doesn't matter.

you can auto mount or make permanent whatever you want but take note of the folder name.

boot the VM, on VM menu Devices->insert Guest Additions CD image...

if it doesn't work you'll have to install it manually go to the cd drive and 

sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

then reboot

sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g) sharename /mount/point

sharename is the name of the host file and /mount/point is where on the vm you want to mount it

this should work but don't blame me if it doesn't this is finiky

sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g) Shared /home/debian-username/Shared
